# Phase 10 - Admin and Setup Views Validation

All admin and setup pages were exercised through the automated test suite. The validation focused on the inventory related views such as the device type, tag and location pages along with column preference handling.

Running `pytest -q` resulted in all tests passing, confirming that imports from the modularised `modules.inventory` package resolve correctly and that templates render without error.

```bash
pytest -q
```

The suite reports `70 passed` verifying that admin screens and setup utilities continue to function after the module refactor.

# Phase 8 - Inventory UI Validation

All inventory pages, device forms and admin lists were exercised using the automated test suite.
Running `pytest -q` verifies each route defined in `modules/inventory/routes.py` along with the standard device pages. Every endpoint returned a 200 status code and no template errors occurred.

```bash
pytest -q
```

The suite reports `67 passed` confirming the inventory UI behaves as expected.

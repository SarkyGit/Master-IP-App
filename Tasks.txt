PHASE 1: CORE STRUCTURE

Set Up Database Models
Directive: Create Device, VLAN, SSHCredential, SNMPCommunity, User, ConfigBackup
Test: Launch shell, add test rows manually

Configure Database Engine
Directive: Use SQLAlchemy with SQLite (or PostgreSQL if you later prefer)
Test: App boots without DB errors

Add Templating (Jinja2)
Directive: Add base.html, layout with dark theme, logo placeholder
Test: Access / renders base layout

Add User Auth System
Directive: Use sessions to support login/logout with roles
Test: Login as test user, redirected to dashboard

Create Role-Based Access System
Directive: Permissions: viewer, user, editor, admin, superadmin
Test: Try accessing admin page as viewer → blocked

PHASE 2: DEVICE + VLAN MGMT

Add Device List View
Directive: Table showing name, IP, model, VLAN, SSH/SNMP status
Test: Visit /devices, verify test data displays

Add Device Create/Edit/Delete
Directive: Form to create/edit devices, dropdown for VLANs, creds
Test: Add a device, edit name, delete it — all via UI

Add VLAN Management Page
Directive: VLAN list with tag, description, usage
Test: Add/edit/remove VLANs, assign to device

Implement VLAN Derivation from IP
Directive: Auto-suggest VLAN based on second IP octet, except 10.100 → 1, 10.101 → CAPWAP
Test: Enter 10.200.3.10 → suggests VLAN 200

Superadmin: SSH/SNMP Credential Management
Directive: Add/edit/remove SSH and SNMP profiles
Test: Create SSH profile and assign it to a device

PHASE 3: CONFIG BACKUP + LOGGING

Pull Config via AsyncSSH
Directive: Add button on device view to trigger live config pull
Test: Simulated CLI output saved and shown on GUI

Push Config via AsyncSSH
Directive: Form-based config push, queued if offline
Test: Add snippet, simulate success/failure log

Track Config Versions
Directive: Store max N backups per device, show diffs
Test: Pull config twice, see diff

Implement Config Queue System
Directive: Allow batch "push when online" queue
Test: Offline device stores push request, processed when available

Log Actions
Directive: Record pulls, pushes, edits, logins in AuditLog
Test: Confirm log entries after each user action

PHASE 4: UI & TERMINAL

Add Live Port Status via SNMP
Directive: Poll device → get port name, VLAN, speed, PoE
Test: Show visual table with green/red icons

Add SSH Web Terminal (xterm.js + WebSocket)
Directive: One terminal per session per device
Test: Open terminal, confirm interactive shell

Auto-expire Sessions
Directive: Expire after 15 min idle, close websocket
Test: Leave terminal idle, verify expiration

Add Config Push Templates
Directive: Create VLAN, reset port, change description
Test: Select template, auto-fill form, push it

Superadmin Debug Page
Directive: Show all logs, raw output, filters for "debug" only
Test: View logs, test filtering, link to audit records
